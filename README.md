# hello-world

About me:

I am a candidate for a MA in International Relations from SFSU and I received my BA in Psychology and Religious Studies from Gonzaga University (yes, the one with the basketball team). I am also an experienced full-cycle recruiter and administrator. I have a passion for learning about corporate social responsibility, socio-economic development, and humanitarian/environmental services. I have a particular interest in developing my skills in organizational leadership, learning, and development. I continue to apply my background in higher education, program ideation, recruiting, and international immersion to establish diverse networks and advance my own education and the education and development of others.
I am constantly in the service of those around me and in every undertaking I strive to foster an environment of respect, inclusion, value-recognition, learning, and development. I have a particular interest in growing my skills in organizational leadership, learning, and development in order to help organizations, and the people within them, thrive in a way that maximizes personal strengths, value, and potential.
