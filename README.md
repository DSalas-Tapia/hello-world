# hello-world

About me:

I am a candidate for a MA in International Relations from SFSU and I received my BA in Psychology and Religious Studies from Gonzaga University (yes, the one with the basketball team). I am also an experienced full-cycle recruiter, administrator, and MA candidate. I have a passion for learning about corporate social responsibility, socio-economic development, and humanitarian/environmental services in the private sector. I have a particular interest in developing my skills in organizational leadership and development. I continue to apply my background in program ideation, recruiting, and international immersion to establish and advance diverse personal and professional networks.
